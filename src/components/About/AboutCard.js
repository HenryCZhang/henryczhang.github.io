              Hi! I am <span className="purple">Henry (Cao) Zhang</span>.
              I consider myself an affable and collaborative individual, with a
              genuine commitment to nurturing enduring professional connections.
              Following the successful completion of my Bachelor's degree in
              Software Engineering, I have embarked on a journey to further
              expand my horizons by pursuing a Master's degree in Information
              Systems Management. This transition represents a deliberate shift
              from my background in software development towards a broader
              understanding of information systems management, demonstrating my
              eagerness to explore new facets of the field.
